My Portfolio


## AIM
My intention was to create a clean design, focusing more on the content. I used a simple white and purple color theme for the branding of each page.I decided to go with separate pages for each section, instead of a one-pager because I think making separate pages are more easier for
me and they are also user-friendly too.

### Home

This is the first page that people will see, so I want a very clear and simple navigation structure that i have learned from w3schools. I have added a my name followed by some infomation about me.I have also added my picture below that.

Secondly, the next div I added is to put the random information about me so that the my portfolio looks casual yet professional at the same time. I added a image saying some "random things about me" followed by the card listing my random things people would like to know.

Thirdly,the next div I created to add a graph chart showing my Technical skills. 

At the end of the page, I have created a footer showing all my social links such as Facebook, Instagram, Github and Codepen. I have found these social links images from the fontawesome.com

### Portfolio

I made a portfolio of my pictures like a photo gallery. It is responsive. At the end of the page, I have created a footer showing all my social links such as Facebook, Instagram, Github and Codepen. I have found these social links images from the fontawesome.com

### Contact Me

I made a simple and elegant looking contact page with the basic form. At the end of the page, I have created a footer showing all my social links such as Facebook, Instagram, Github and Codepen. I have found these social links images from the fontawesome.com

### About ME

I made it quite simple. I made a card that has my image in it with the caption stating that I am a Full Stack Developer.
I also added a image of "know all about me from A to Z" from google search. It is a image with white background that is complimentinh
my portfolio theme. Below that I have written an introduction about myself.At the end of the page, I have created a footer showing all my social links such as Facebook, Instagram, Github and Codepen.

## Designs

Initially i was using Figma to create my design for the website but later I made by design myself with a simple white and purple 
theme.

## Building

I tried to go as minimal as possible with HTML & CSS. I was using bootstrap at the starting but I dropped that idea because 
it is making my portfolio more complicated.

### HTML

I built my website in HTML5, using tags such as `<div>',`<header>` and `<footer>` to add more meaning to my structure.

### Meta tags

I add `description` and `author` meta tags to my primary pages: Home and About. The others I may still add down the road.

### CSS

I have made my CSS very organised by stating comments with their page title so that it is easy to understand. 

### Images & Icons

My images are pretty minimal. My main home page image and my about me iamge is uploaded from my system as they are my pictures. Other Images that are used in home page and about me page are searched and uploaded from the google. I used only PNGs and jpgs.

The icons i.e smiley emoticon on my About page are the images I use from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/),
as they have good catalog of emoticons. I sized the logos to 200% size, using `font-size: 200%` in CSS.
